<p>What is a Port?</p>
<p>A port is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer. Can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to computer or over the internet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Characteristics</p>
<p>A port has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>External devices are connected to a computer using cables and ports.</p>
<p>Ports are slots on the motherboard into which a cable of external device is plugged in.</p>
<p>Examples of external devices attached via ports are mouse, keyboard, monitor, microphone, speakers etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Computer Ports</p>
<p>Following are few important types of ports:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Serial Port</p>
<p>Used for external modems and older computer mouse</p>
<p>Two versions : 9 pin, 25 pin model</p>
<p>Data travels at 115 kilobits per second</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Parallel Port</p>
<p>Used for scanners and printers</p>
<p>Also called printer port</p>
<p>25 pin model</p>
<p>Also known as IEEE 1284-compliant Centronics port</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PS/2 Port</p>
<p>Used for old computer keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>Also called mouse port</p>
<p>Most of the old computers provide two PS/2 port, each for mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>Also known as IEEE 1284-compliant Centronics port</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Universal Serial Bus (or USB) Port</p>
<p>It can connect all kinds of external USB devices such as external hard disk, printer, scanner, mouse, keyboard etc.</p>
<p>It was introduced in 1997.</p>
<p>Most of the computers provide two USB ports as minimum.</p>
<p>Data travels at 12 megabits per seconds</p>
<p>USB compliant devices can get power from a USB port</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VGA Port</p>
<p>Connects monitor to a computer's video card.</p>
<p>Has 15 holes.</p>
<p>Similar to serial port connector but serial port connector has pins, it has holes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Power Connector</p>
<p>Three-pronged plug</p>
<p>Connects to the computer's power cable that plugs into a power bar or wall socket</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firewire Port</p>
<p>Transfers large amount of data at very fast speed.</p>
<p>Connects camcorders and video equipments to the computer</p>
<p>Data travels at 400 to 800 megabits per seconds</p>
<p>Invented by Apple</p>
<p>Three variants : 4-Pin FireWire 400 connector, 6-Pin FireWire 400 connector and 9-Pin FireWire 800 connector</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Modem Port</p>
<p>Connects a PC's modem to the telephone network</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ethernet Port</p>
<p>Connects to a network and high speed Internet.</p>
<p>Connect network cable to a computer.</p>
<p>This port resides on an Ethernet Card.</p>
<p>Data travels at 10 megabits to 1000 megabits per seconds depending upon the network bandwidth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Game Port</p>
<p>Connect a joystick to a PC</p>
<p>Now replaced by USB.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Digital Video Interface, DVI port</p>
<p>Connects Flat panel LCD monitor to the computer's high end video graphic cards.</p>
<p>Very popular among video card manufacturers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sockets</p>
<p>Connect microphone, speakers to sound card of the computer</p>
