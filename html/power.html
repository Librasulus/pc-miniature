<p>Two main sets of motherboard power connectors have been used over the years: what I would call AT/LPX type and the ATX type. Each of these has minor variations; for example, the ATX type has evolved over the years, with new connectors coming (and some going) and modifications to existing connectors. This section details the motherboard power connectors used by various types of industry-standard (and some not-so-standard) power supplies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>AT/LPX Power Supply Connectors</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Industry-standard PC, XT, AT, Baby-AT, and LPX motherboards use the same type of main power supply connectors. AT/LPX power supplies feature two main power connectors (P8 and P9), each with six pins that attach the power supply to the motherboard. The terminals used in these connectors are rated to handle up to five amps at up to 250 V (even though the maximum used in a PC is +12 V). </p>

<p>ATX and ATX12V Motherboard Power Connectors</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Power supplies conforming to the original ATX and ATX12V 1.x form factor standards or variations thereof use the following three motherboard power connectors:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>20-pin main power connector</p>
<p>Six-pin auxiliary power connector</p>
<p>Four-pin +12 V power connector</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main power connector is always required, but the other two are optional depending on the application. Consequently, a given ATX or ATX12V power supply can have up to four combinations of connectors, as listed here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Main power connector only</p>
<p>Main and auxiliary</p>
<p>Main and +12 V</p>
<p>Main, auxiliary, and +12 V</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most common varieties are those including the main only and those with the main and +12 V connectors. Most motherboards that use the +12 V connector do not use the auxiliary connector, and vice versa.</p>
