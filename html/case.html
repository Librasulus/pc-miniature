A computer case also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, cabinet, base unit or simply case is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard and mouse).

Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC â€” Steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil) or aluminium. Plastic is sometimes used, and other materials such as glass, wood and even Lego blocks have appeared in home-built cases.
